# Fallout Terminal Hacker

Fallout Terminal Hacker is a little nonsense project I did to get started programming on Android. It's a small little app that helps you solve the Hacking-Minigame in Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas.

The GUI is kind of shit, but I was more focused on getting the hang of the basics in Android development. If you want to use part of it or you want to use the code and make it prettier you are very much welcomed to do so, but please mention me somewhere.
